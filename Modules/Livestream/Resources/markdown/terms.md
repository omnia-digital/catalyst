<h4>OUR MISSION STATEMENT</h4>

The mission of Omnia is to advance the Kingdom of God on Earth through the development of software and other tools that will benefit the worldwide Church by focusing on the needs of every church, ministry, and person. To this end, Omnia will strive to provide lessons that follow these general guidelines:

- Lessons, teachings, and messages that promote the teachings of the Bible (especially those of Jesus) and/or how they are applied individually and in the church, and are based on:
- The Bible is the inspired Word of God and is the authoritative source for teaching,
- The characteristics and nature of God are revealed in the Bible, and
- Jesus is the Son of God and was born human, died, was resurrected, ascended into heaven, and provides eternal life for those who believe in him.
- Omnia reserves the right to refuse service to organizations promoting religious ideas contrary to those guidelines above, including religions such as Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism; including Christian offshoots such as Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Church of Christ (Scientist); and, including cults of any kind.
- All lessons on the Omnia website must: not promote violence, not promote any political party, not be focused on fund-raising or advertising, follow all laws of the United States of America 
(including copyright laws), and not endanger the non-profit status of any organization affiliated with Omnia.
- The enforcement of these policies will be done through the oversight of employees, a Policy Committee, and the Board of Advisors. In general, Omnia will rely on an honor system for lessons to be posted, but will rely on listeners and high-level technology to report violations to its policies.
